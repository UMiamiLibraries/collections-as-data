MODEL TEACHERS, MODEL AIRPLANES AND AVIATION EDUCATION WORKSHOPS
For this discussion I’ll ask you to think of a model teacher in the sense listed by Webster as archetype, or an example for imitation.
I hold that a teacher who takes a genuine interest in the construction and flying of a model airplane is indeed a model teacher, worthy of imitation by all teachers interested in aviation education.
For a model for model teachers interested in model airplanes, see the picture on this page of National Junior Champion Brent Hawkins with the model which won him first place in PAA-Load Junior Jet at the National Model Airplane Championships last summer.
Using a picture of Brent and his model as an illustration for this article is in the best tradition of aviation education. If memory serves, the first “profound” observation ever made to this writer on the subject of aviation education was that teachers had to find out about airplanes in self defense. The youngsters knew more about aviation than did their teachers, so the theory went, and they had to get themselves educated in aviation just to hold their own.
Among aviation education enthusiasts, that observation about the students knowing more about aviation than the teachers has become a frayed cliche, but there still is enough unfortunate truth in it to make it worth repeating. However, there now are several thousand teachers who have participated in aviation education work shops at summer schools in recent years, and to those teachers the cliche definitely is not applicable.
During the summer session season of 1956 your correspondent visited a number of the aviation education workshops, and found in most cases that along with indoctrination in the fundamentals of aerodynamics, internal combustion engines, jet

engines, navigation, meteorology, uses of the airplane and the history of aviation, there was a new interest in building model and flying model airplanes.
Model aviation has been an integral part of aviation education workshops from the beginning, so it is not intended here to imply that there has been a gap which now is being filled. It is intended rather to report that more attention and emphasis seems to be given to this important phase of the work shop program.
With that much encouragement your reporter can’t resist the urge to do a little plugging for modeling.
For buttressing an idea, what could be better than reference to a principle set forth in a highly regarded educational

JUNIOR CHAMP—Brent Hawkins of Morton, Illinois examines the model with which he won PAA-Load, Junior Jet at the National Model Airplane Championships in 1956. By his total performance at NATS, Brent became Junior National Champion for 1956.
magazine? The NEA Journal for October gives me a chance to do just that. For the October Journal Alice Miel wrote an article with the title, “When Resources are for Children, More Learning Takes Place.” The caption on a picture of youngsters busy with their art project asks, “Are art supplies for the children to use or for the teacher to guard?”
Carrying that thought across to the proposition of model aviation and aviation education, I’ll submit that when model building is for teachers in a work shop—when the teachers take balsa wood and glue and construct flying machines that fly, more learning about the principles aerodynamics takes place.
And in the fall, when the teachers return to their own class rooms, with a lot of new background in aviation and its role in science, geography, social studies and government, if they encourage model building by their students when it comes time to talk about aerodynamics, more learning about aerodynamics will take place.
Furthermore, the teacher who is so fortunate as to have a Brent Hawkins in her class will find more learning taking place for her students, and for herself. There are many such hoys, and girls, too. Although there is only one Junior National Champion each year, there are thousands of others who are capable of giving the Brents worthy competition.
Model aviation has an enormously wide range of categories, with widely varying requirements as to skill.
The simplest model of all is a hand launched stick glider. A little more complicated is a stick-fuselage model with rubber power to turn a propeller. Somewhat more tricky to build, hut just as easy to fly, is a rubber-powered model with a built-up
