INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS
Ten years ago, in discussions between the U. S. State Department and Pan American World Airways, it was agreed that the growing volume of travel abroad by tourists and business men called for a hotel development program—one in which U.S. businessmen could assist businessmen in the countries where new hotels were needed to build and equip the hotels required.
The result was Intercontinental Hotels Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pan American World Airways, which in ten years has become the largest American overseas hotel corporation.
The growing roster of Intercontinental hotels presently reads: the smartly modern Hotels Tamanaco in Caracas, and Del Lageo in Maracaibo, Venezuela; Tequendama in Bogota, Colombia, and Victoria Plaza in Montevideo, Uruguay — designed and operated by Intercontinental for their owners.
Also the Hotels Reforma in Mexico City, Nacional de Cuba in Havana, Carrera in Santiago, Chile, and Grande in Belem, Brazil.
Intercontinental represents throughout the world such renowned hotels as the Plaza in Buenos Aires and the Gran Hotel Bolivar and Country Club de Lima in Lima, Peru.
In Beirut, capital of Lebanon, the 300-room Phenicia-Intercontinental will open in 1958.
Four new hotels are under construction in Salvador, San Juan, Curacao and Guatemala City. (See photos.)
