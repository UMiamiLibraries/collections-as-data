fuselage having spars and ribs, and covered with paper.
Models of these types are customarily built in aviation education work shops. For convenience of setting up a work shop project, and for a class room project for students, there is a kit of materials which includes the necessary balsa wood and accessories for all three. It is the official Civil Air Patrol model airplane kit, produced by Berkeley Models expressly for the C. A. P. It is available through Civil Air Patrol channels, and it also is stocked by hobby shops. If it is not in stock at your hobby shop, other kits are to be had, and the hobby shop man will be pleased to advise.
For a great many teachers, and for a great many youngsters, this much progress along the model aviation trail will be enough. Thereafter they will turn to other interests, but they’ll have learned a great deal about aerodynamics by going that far.
Other teachers have gone a great deal farther in model aviation than the three basic steps mentioned above.
There is Frank Bushev of Connecticut, a class room teacher all his life, who has been President of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, Director of PAA-Load Event at the Mirror Model Flying Fair, conductor of a summer camp with model aviation as a major activity and a man with many other interests in modeling, in addition to building them.
There is C.O. Wright, Executive Secretary of the Kansas State Teachers Association, also a former President of the Academy of Model Aeronautics, and an outstanding contestant every year at the National Model Airplane Championships.
Model Aviation embraces model flying with gas powered free flight aircraft — they take off and fly on their own. It includes
the control line models which fly at the end of wires — round and round in circles. (There is good-natured mutual contempt between the two groups, and each has a nickname for the other. For control line fans, the term is Yo Yo Flyers. The free flighters are Flea Frighters.)
In control line flying there are a variety of specialties: Speed flying, in a number of engine sizes. Acrobatic flying. Team racing. Carrier Flying, a contest introduced by the U.S. Navy which simulates the operation of aircraft from the deck of a carrier.
In Free Flight there are variations. Contests are held for models with different types of power. There are gliders launched by hand, or with kite strings. There are rubber-powered, and gas-powered models. There are models powered with jet-type engines. There is a category for free flight models carrying payload: the PAA-Load competition sponsored by Pan American World Airways.
The latter is a contest category introduced by Pan American World Airways to provide a basis for similarity between model flying and the operation of real, full-scale aircraft. Real aircraft carry pay-load in the form of passengers, mail and cargo — that is their reason for being. The models competing in PAA-Load are required to carry simulated passengers and cargo.
The model folks say the boys who are interested in model aviation don’t become juvenile delinquents. Not if they’re really interested in modeling. Because if they are, they just don’t have any time for juvenile delinquency.
For all of us, though, the important thing is that an introduction to model aviation constitutes an introduction to aviation itself. It’s an interesting, even fascinating, route to the indoctrination in aviation which has become an absolute must for people who are so fortunate as to have been born in the Air Age.

Flying Makes The World Smaller
Bringing peoples and places closer together the world over is one of the nicest things about running an international airline. Pan American knows that teachers share this common effort to better understanding. PAA’s educational services are designed to help you and your students reach out to broader horizons. If your answers to any of the following questions are “Yes,” then perhaps you’ll find our materials useful.
