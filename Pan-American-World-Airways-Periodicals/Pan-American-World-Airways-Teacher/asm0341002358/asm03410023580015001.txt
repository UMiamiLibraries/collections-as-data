FIRST U.S. GUIDEBOOK TO PROMOTE TRAVEL TO THE UNITED STATES
An encyclopedic guidebook to the United States has been published by Pan American Airways primarily as a service to persons in other countries who are planning visits to American cities and resorts.
“New Horizons, U.S.A.,” compiled with the assistance of American Airlines and tourist information organizations in all 48 states and in 89 major cities, is patterned after PAA’s guide to foreign countries, “New Horizons,” which has now sold over half a million copies.
Willis G. Lipscomb, Vice President, Traffic and Sales, said he knew of no comparable national guide. Though primarily designed for overseas consumption, the book will he equally useful for domestic travelers, he pointed out.
Less rigid currency controls and more prosperous world business conditions made a trip to the United States possible for half a million visitors in 1955. This figure represents an increase of 36 per cent in five years.
The guidebook will be published in French, German, Italian and Spanish as well as English. The English edition will have an initial printing of 80,000 copies. Foreign editions will follow. The book will be sold through normal bookstore channels in the U.S. and abroad as well as through PAA’s 600 offices in 80 countries around the world. Foreign travel agents will also sell the book. Simon and Schuster is the U.S. publisher.
The 510-page book groups 89 U.S. cities into six regions, the Northeast, Southeast, North-Central, South-Central, the Northwest and Southwest. Information for each city covers 31 categories, among them hotel accommodations, local points of interest and history, characteristics and customs, restaurants, shops and stores, foreign nationalities represented, arts and music, sports, theatres, fairs and exhibitions, colleges and schools, climate and vacation areas in the region.
Foreign visitors will not feel completely out of touch with home in most U.S. cities, the book suggests. New York has 75 foreign-language newspapers, Chicago 21, Detroit 18 and many other cities have one or two.
The book includes, a long section on naturalization and visa information. There are notes on the cost of living, telephone and telegraph facilities, mail, employment, heating and air conditioning (for most foreign visitors too hot in the winter and too cold in the summer), automobile rental, American money, holidays, meal hours, hotel service and time zones.
Tables give conversions from foreign weights and measures to American. For instance, a 37 size shirt in Europe would be size 15 in the U.S. A French size 46 dress is not, as in America, the largest size available, but a median size 18 in American measure.
The book sells in the U.S. at $1.95. It may be obtained direct from the airline or by writing Box 1111, New York 17, N. Y.

JET STEWARDESSES
By Louise Lasker
Stewardess, Pan American World Airways
When I returned to Seattle after a flight to Alaska, I was asked if I’d like to go to Wichita on the Boeing 707 prototype.
Would I! The best I had hoped for— and I had been hoping —was just to get aboard and see what the 707 looked like inside. The news that I was scheduled to be one of the first two girls to serve as stewardesses on America’s first jet airliner dropped on me like a rainbow out of Seattle’s gray sky. It wasn’t raining raindrops, it was raining French perfume.
We went aboard the 707 about noon at Boeing Field. In a few minutes our passengers began to arrive — members of the Boeing board of directors and their wives, going to Wichita for a meeting. Beverly An-

derson of Northwest Airlines and I got them seated.
I’ve flown more than 3,300 hours in piston-engined planes, but our takeoff in the 707 was a brand-new experience, smooth as a silk nightgown. There wasn’t the familiar vibration and straining noise of piston engines.
We just swooshed down the runway and into the air without effort. The steady sound of the jet engines — we couldn’t hear much more than a deep drone in the forward cabin — never varied whether we were climbing or cruising. Because there was no vibration, the engines hardly seemed part of the plane. They just hummed along bv themselves out in the cold.
The plane climbed to 35,000 feet for cruising. Beverly and I served box lunches and hot coffee or tea. I discovered that I could set full cups of coffee on the galley table and they never moved.
The passengers were delighted with the easy smoothness of the flight — it was hard to believe we are traveling about 500 miles per hour. The pilots were enjoying it just like everyone else. I couldn’t hear the engines at all in the cockpit. There was just a cozy sound like you hear in a warm house when a winter wind is making a low whistle outside.
We crossed Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and most of Kansas and landed at Wichita —all in 2 hours and 48 minutes. Obviously stewardesses will be working much shorter hours on 707 flights. It might mean that on some flights food service will be unnecessary.
The trip was a wonderful experience to me. Now I know why the pilots just love that plane.
