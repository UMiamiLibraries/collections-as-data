Summer Session at San Marcos
TOUR BASING FARES
(Continued from Page 1)
down the west coast of South America would include Balboa and Panama, with a full day of sightseeing before going on to Lima, Peru, by Panagra on the trip down the west coast of South America.
Lima, known as the city of the kings, is famed for its architecture and its hospitality. Two days of sightseeing are allowed in the Peruvian capital with guides to show the great cathedral, the Spanish Moorish house of the Torre Tagle family, San Marcos University and the Inca and pre-Inca relics at the National Museum.
Considerable variation is possible in the planning of specific tours. For example, the Lima tour may be used as the basis for a trip to Lima for attendance at the summer session of San Marcos University. Since more time will be required than the 15 days of the basic tour the cost will be increased by the amount required for living expenses during the additional period and tuition costs would have to be met as well. Both, however, are extremely reasonable.
The famous tourist attractions of the Inca empire are only a few hours by air from Lima and are available at the same low rates, on an extended tour, or on a prearranged trip just to the Inca land.

Two full days of the tour are spent in Santiago, Chile, with its centuries-old bridges, spanning the river which cuts the city in two, its beautiful churches and Santiago’s crowning glory, the magnificent views from Santa Lucia Hill and the Cerro San Cristobel.
Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina and largest city in South America, is the next two-day stopover. Here the great parks, wide boulevards, the museums and theatres will be the chief points of tourist interest in this modern, thriving metropolis.
From Buenos Aires the tour goes up the east coast by Pan American Clipper to Montevideo, Uruguay, for a day followed by two days in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The last stopover in South America is Rio de Janeiro, often described as the gayest and most beautiful city on earth. Rio’s mosaic sidewalks, open air cafes, the Copacabana beach and the thrilling ride by cable car to the summit of Sugar Loaf Mountain, of course, are world famous.
After Rio, the final port of call is San Juan, Puerto Rico, and then back to the U. S. A. mainland.
The famous summer session of the University of San Marcos, at Lima, Peru, will open this year on July 2nd and run through August 15 th.
Dr. Augusto Tamayo Vargas, Director of the School visited the United States recently, and explained his plans for this summer which include offerings in a Literature Section, a History Section, an Archaeology Section, a Geography Section and a Spanish Language Section. Also this year the University offers an “Intensive Spanish Course” for students who wish to concentrate solely upon the study of the language.
Courses are set up so as to yield five credits each under the Peruvian system, and it is possible to earn as many as 25 credits. For conversion, count 2credit hours as being the equivalent of one semester hour credit in the U.S.—but if credit transfer to a university in the U.S. is desired it is essential to check with that University first—-before going to Lima and undertaking the work.
Dr. Tamayo says that a fluent command of Spanish is not necessary, as each student is provided with resumes of the class work in English.
In addition to class work, there is a well-planned program of excursions and evening activities.
Afternoon excursions, by bus, begin at 3:30 p.m. and last until 6 p.m. They include visits to churches, convents and monasteries, the bull ring, the historic fort of Felip Real, museums, private art collections, Old Lima, libraries, the Congress, the Presidential Palace, the site of the Inquisition and other points of interest.
Saturday excursions are all-day affairs, to points outside of Lima and include visits to the archaeological excavations at Ancon, Pachacamac and Cajamarquilla, as well as a trip up the valley of the Rimac River.
Evening activities include lectures, musical programs and visits to the theater, and are worked out in close cooperation with the Peruvian-North American Cultural Institute and the Asociacion de Artistas Aficionados.
San Marcos grants credits for the excursions. Again, it is necessary to check with one’s home university to determine if credit ' transfer will be allowed.
Pan American-Grace Airways and Pan American World Airways are working with the university to set up a “package” offering which will cover transportation, tuition,
room and board and week end excursion trips. Cost is the “tour basing fare” (see page one) of $455 for a 15-day round trip, plus tuition, plus extra living expenses for additional days in Peru.
Application for enrollment is to be sent directly to the School of Special Studies, Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, Casilla 1985, Lima, Peru. The announcement pamphlet includes an application blank, and this pamphlet may be obtained by writing to Educational Director, Pan American World Airways, 28-19 Bridge Plaza North, Long Island City 1, N. Y. The coupon printed on this page may be used to request the pamphlet.
NEA Tours
A brief announcement of the NEA tours for 1950 appeared in the Jan.-Feb. issue of World Airways Teacher. Since that time more information has become available.
The varied and interesting program of NEA tours include two which go beyond the continental limits of the United States.
Central America.—
A tour of Central America will originate in St. Louis on the morning of July 17, for a train trip to New Orleans where the tour members will board a Flying Clipper for Merida, Yucatan. Buses will be provided for a trip to Chichen Itza—the ruins of the ancient Mayan City—and for other trips in the area. The group will continue to San Salvador on July 22, to Guatemala City on July 27, and will return to New Orleans August 4.
Members may join the party at New Orleans instead of St. Louis, if they wish; also they may arrange to stay over longer in Guatemala, or to return on their own to Mexico City and Houston. The NEA Division of Travel Service will gladly make arrangements for the longer stays, and the independent transportation back to the United States.
Cost of this tour, on an all-expense basis is $385 from New Orleans and back to New Orleans, 18 days; $452 for the round trip from St. Louis, 20 days.
Hawaii.—
Tours to Hawaii are offered this year by the NEA Division of Travel Service, with transportation via Pan American World Airways from Portland and Seattle.
The Hawaii Visitors Bureau and the Hawaii Education Association are cooperating, to make sure that tour members will have an enjoyable time, and will have an opportunity to meet people and make observations that will be significant from a professional point of view.
The standard tour is of 15 days duration, but may be lengthened at the option of individual members—at an increase in cost, of course. Activities include a “walkatour” and luncheon in Honolulu’s Oriental business and temple section; visits to schools including the University of Hawaii; tours of private gardens, tea houses, sugar mills, pineapple canneries, Pearl Harbor and an all day circle tour of the island of Oahu, upon which Honolulu is situated. During the second week there is scheduled a five day visit to Molokai, Maui and the other islands of Hawaii.
