INTERNATIONAL AIR CARGO FLIES IN MODEL PLANE
Ray Matthews of Oklahoma City is the first modeler ever to fly international air cargo in a model airplane.
In his Class A PAA Load model, with which he won a first in PAA Load Event at The Nationals of model flying last year, Matthews recently flew a package containing an Elgin watch across the Rio Grande at Laredo, Texas.
The watch is going from John E. Clemens, Contest Director of this year’s Nationals at Dallas, to the Finnish Aero Club in Helsinki, to be presented as a special prize in the international Wakefield contest.
The pictures in the top row show Customs Inspector E. L. Haley handing the package containing the Lord Elgin watch to Matthews (right) with Helper Guy McClure looking on. Matthews and McClure then load the plane and prepare it for takeoff. In the second row of pictures, they launch the plane, which flies across the river into Mexico and is recovered by Fred Whiting, Jr. and George B. Goff, Jr., who then wait for Matthews to get over to Mexico to unwrap the package. Lower right, Matthews delivers the watch to Captain R. Torres Rico, of Compania Mexicana de Aviacion, for onward dispatch as Clipper cargo.
The flight was staged to call attention to PAA Load Event, a special contest to be sponsored by Pan American World Airways this summer at model aircraft meets.
