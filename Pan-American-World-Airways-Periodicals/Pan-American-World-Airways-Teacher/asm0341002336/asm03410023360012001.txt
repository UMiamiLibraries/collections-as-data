It is a 196-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about the countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how
to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
