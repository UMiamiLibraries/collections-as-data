QUICK REFERENCE FACTS
From the PAA Travel Guide “New Horizons”
ENGLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND
LOCATION . . . England and Wales occupy the southern part of the British Isles. Northern Ireland comprises the six northeastern counties of the island to the west of Great Britain.
CHARACTERISTICS . . . England, with all its differences, is the closest thing to home you’ll find abroad. This is mainly because of the language. Don’t let the rumors of austerity keep you from going. The average tourist sees nothing of this. The English, though reserved, are friendly, unfailingly courteous, and their country is filled with history. It is one of the few remaining countries in which royalty is respected and that in itself breeds a tradition and dignity not found elsewhere. London has magnificence and the English countryside is utterly charming. There are places of historic and cultural interest from one end of the “tight little isle” to the other.
POPULATION . . . The population of England and Wales is 43,744,924, a couple of million more than that of France. Northern Ireland has a population of 1,380,000.
SIZE ... The area of England is 50,874 square miles, about the size of Alabama. Wales, with 7,466 square miles, is the size of New Jersey. Northern Ireland, with 5,238 square miles is a little larger than Connecticut.
CAPITAL . . . London, the largest city in the world, has a population of 8,346,137, the population of New York plus Cincinnati. Belfast (population 448,000) is the capital of Northern Ireland.
GOVERNMENT . . . The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with the Crown Colonies, of course, form a constitutional monarchy with executive power held by the Prime Minister, who must be supported by a majority of the House of Commons. Parliament consists of two Chambers: the House of Commons, whose members are elected directly by the people, and the House of Lords, whose members sit for life, either by hereditary right, by appointment by the Queen, or by virtue of office.
HOW TO GET THERE ... By de luxe Clipper service “The President,” or new Tourist Service “The Rainbow,” 12J4 hours from New York, 19 hours from Chicago via Detroit to London. By ship, about 5 days.
SCOTLAND
LOCATION . . . Scotland occupies the northern part of the Island of Great Britain. Edinburgh is 327 miles from London by air.
CHARACTERISTICS . . . The bonnie braes of Scotland are well worth a visit. Edinburgh, although conservative, is a lovely city, and of course the Scottish lochs and highlands are famous the world over. Fishermen and hunters will find Scotland just right for them. The lochs and streams abound in trout and salmon, and the shooting is internationally famous. The Scots themselves, though reserved, are wonderfully friendly. No trin to the British Isles is complete without a tour of this rugged, independent little country which has magnificent scenery and many interesting places to visit.
POPULATION . . . Estimated 5,095,969, roughly the population of Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Baltimore combined.
SIZE . . . 30,405 square miles, the size of South Carolina.
CAPITAL . . . Whereas London is the capital of Great Britain, Edinburgh is the recognized and constituted capital of Scotland.
GOVERNMENT ... A part of the United Kingdom.
HOW TO GET THERE . . . By Pan American Clipper, New York direct to Glasgow (Prestwick Airport) 13 hours, about 16 hours from Chicago via Detroit. By ship, about 5 days.
The information presented under the heading “Quick Reference Facts” is from the PAA travel guide book New Horizons, 1954 revised edition.
“New Horizons” is a 576-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about 78 countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
The new edition, publication date May 15, 1954, is enlarged in all sections, includes 15 countries not represented in the earlier editions, and is printed in handy pocket size.
When New Horizons was first offered to the traveling public in Pan American World Airways national advertising, thousands of teachers responded by ordering the book, to assist them in travel plans, and for use in geography gnd social studies classes.
As a convenience for teachers who haven’t acquired their copies, or who now wish to order the new edition, a coupon is printed below.

vidual schools and proceeding through other screening operations which result in the selection of a small group of boys and girls who are interviewed by a committee representing the country’s Ministry of Education and the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Cultural Affairs, the competition in a country normally involves several thousand aspirants for the appointment.
Throughout this screening process five major personality qualifications are guides for the judges: and these were explained in letters to educational authorities abroad as follows:
“An active interest in world affairs, coupled with basic knowledge of the home country and some understanding of its problems.
“Intellectual curiosity, ability to adapt readily to unfamiliar situations, interest in new experience for its own sake.
“Working knowledge of the English language. Delegates must be articulate if they are to represent their countries well in forums and classroom discussions here.
“Excellent health is an absolute requisite. The three months here will be strenuous. Experience shows that guest and host are equally determined to get as much as possible out of the brief visit, usually (and in spite of all we can do) at the expense of sleep.
“Personal appearance is an important consideration, since delegates come into brief contact with so many people (in large school assemblies, television appearances, etc.) many of whom will inevitably judge the delegates and their countries by fleeting first impressions.”
The thirty-two boys and girls who were selected to represent their countries arrived in New York City in late December and early January. First stop for all of them was Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N. Y., largely vacated because of Christmas holidays, where the visitors from abroad had an opportunity to meet each other, and receive some preliminary briefing upon the ways of the United States, and especially New York City.
Then each proceeded to the home of a host student in New York City, for a two weeks visit, and subsequently moved to another home, and then another, until each delegate had been the guest of five different New York area teenagers. Delegates attended school with their hosts, participating in assembly programs, class room discussions and social activities. At intervals the whole group of foreign delegates came together for special purposes, including a trip to Washington for a visit with President Eisenhower.
They participated in two series of TV programs, one an evening series over WOR-TV and the other a New York City Board of Education series televised by WPIX as a part of “The Living Blackboard” which is an educational program for New York schools.
The forum, on March 27, was held this year for the first time in the new General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, which was filled to capacity with high school students from New York and vicinity. Frank P. Graham, United Nations Repre-
