SKYGIRL, By Mary F. Murray. Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 256 pp. $3.00.
The air line stewardess is a member of a profession to which “many are called and few are chosen.” Trying for a stewardess job and missing is no occasion to feel humiliation—a special type of personality is required, and even those who select stewardesses find it a little difficult to put their personality standards into words.
And even though thousands of girls apply for such positions every year, the air lines still have to advertise for candidates at times.
For those who have such aspirations, SKYGIRL is a book which really has the answers. Its author is Director of Stewardess Training at the Aviation Training School in Boston, and there is a foreword by Ellen Church, who, in 1930, became the first stewardess on any air line in America.
After a brief discussion of the history of aviation in this country, the book starts right in with the question: “Do you have what it takes to be an airline stewardess?” and proceeds to set forth in great detail the facts and figures which will enable a con-didate to decide.
The clear and interesting text is supplemented by a generous selection of photographic illustrations which have been selected with care to further explain the job of being a stewardess.

$225 Fare for the Atlantic
A tourist class service for trans-Atlantic travel has been announced by Pan American World Airways. The fare proposed is $225 one way, $405 round trip as compared with $395 one way and $711 round trip for the regular service.
The announcement said it was the air line’s intention to inaugurate this service on April 1, 1952.
It seems safe to assume that readers of World Airways Teacher all are interested in travel for educational purposes, and since it is obvious that reduction in the cost of travel will stimulate more of it, a review of what has happened in the development of tourist class service seems in order at this point.
Tourist class service, also sometimes called air coach service, makes possible a lower rate by “high density seating” and the elimination of certain luxuries associated with the de luxe type of air service. High density seating means that seats are a little closer together and more passengers are carried, with the result that each pays substantially less. Light lunches are served, instead of elaborate hot meals—in some cases where flights are not too long there is no food service at all. Operating standards are exactly the same—crew members must have the same qualifications and experience, and are subject to the same procedures and regulations that they are in the deluxe services.
The saving to the passenger may be illustrated by comparing the tourist class fare for New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico (the first service of this type to be established) with the regular fare: $64, one way, for tourist class and $108 for first class. Or the projected trans-Atlantic tourist fare of $225 may be compared with the first class fare of $395.
The original tourist class service between New York City and San Juan began in 1948. The volume of traffic soon tripled, and the first class service, instead of losing to the tourist class, actually registered a gain.
Thus encouraged, PAA extended tourist service to routes all around South America, and to Bermuda. Meanwhile, domestic lines operating within the United States, inaugurated tourist class services on a number of routes, including the transcontinental ones, and have found it difficult to keep pace with the demand. They gained $43,000,000 in revenue, and their first class services registered $14,000,000 of this gain.
Tourist class service for the Atlantic was proposed by PAA as early as 1948, and in April, 1951, the Civil Aeronautics Board
told Pan American and TWA that recognition should now be given to the tourist class idea across the Atlantic.
As fare structures, along with many other matters affecting traffic and operations in international transport operations, customarily are based upon agreements concluded by the International Air Transport Association (since international agreements are necessary to have air service at all) the proposal was considered in a meeting of IATA in Bermuda in May, 1951, and again in London in September, 1951. The Bermuda meeting resulted in an agreement on the principle of the tourist class idea, but with restrictions which were not acceptable to the Civil Aeronautics Board. When the subject was reconsidered in the London meeting and agreement could not be reached, PAA announced its intention of “going it alone” on tourist service.
The subject will be discussed again in an IATA meeting in November. Further developments undoubtedly will be reported in the daily press and news magazines. World Airways Teacher also will report to you. Meanwhile, readers who feel inclined to comment are invited to write and state their views, whether as to the principles involved, or as to plans for travel.
Spanish Lessons on Records
The RCA Victor New World Spanish record series now is available on 45 r.p.m. vinyl plastic records, in addition to the 78 r.p.m. version on ten inch records.
Authors of the series are Henry Grattan Doyle, Professor of Romance Languages and Dean of Columbian College, The George Washington University and Francisco Aguilera, Assistant Director, Hispanic Foundation, The Library of Congress.
Recordings were made by native speakers, and two men and one woman are heard, to assure variety and to demonstrate conversational use of the Spanish language. Initial lessons are recorded at slow pace, and without staccato effects, to enable beginners to get started on vocabulary, enunciation and intonation with facility. Later records are spoken at normal speed.
An accompanying text book contains all directions and interpretations—recorded matter being devoted entirely to Spanish. There is an introduction devoted to Spanish grammar, then a discussion of Spanish verbs. The first two lessons in the book deal with the matter of the first two record sides on Spanish pronounciation. Texts of lessons three to forty, as recorded on the records, also are printed in the book.
The record sets are available from RCA Victor dealers.
