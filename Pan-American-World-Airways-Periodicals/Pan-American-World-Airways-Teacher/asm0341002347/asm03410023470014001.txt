UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA
LOCATION ... At the southern tip of Africa lies the Union of South Africa, comprising the provinces of Cape of Good Flope (Cape Province), Natal, Orange Free State, and Transvaal where Johannesburg is located.	^
CHARACTERISTICS ... Here is a land of contrasts of wonderful tropical beaches, lush foliage, brilliant sunshine and high cool mountains, rugged terrain and endless stretches of veld. Brilliant flowers bloom in profusion along the South African coast. Capetown and Durban are cosmopolitan and gay. There are excellent hotels, wonderful swimming and fishing and all the gaiety you want. To the north, Johannesburg offers an interesting city with a marvelous cool climate. Kruger National Park, the sanctuary for wild animals, is an un-forgetable spot. So for that matter is all of South Africa with its color, strangeness and allure.
POPULATION ... Estimated 12,646,375 (equal to the population of New York City and Chicago). Capetown with about 238,777 inhabitants is about the size of Milwaukee. Johannesburg with about 880,000 is slightly smaller than Minneapolis-St. Paul.
SIZE ... 472,550 square miles, one sixth the size of the United States.
CAPITAL ... Pretoria is the administrative capital; Capetown, the legislative capital.
GOVERNMENT ... a self-governing British Dominion; a Governor-General represents the King.
HOW TO GET THERE ... By Pan American Clipper, 54^ hours from New York to Johannesburg. By South African Airways, 4 hours from Johannesburg to Capetown. By ship about 17 days from New York.
The information above is quoted from “New Horizons”, which is Pan American World Airways’ travel handbook.
“New Horizons” is a 196-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about the countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
When Nezv Horizons was first offered to the traveling public in Pan American World Airways national advertising, thousands of teachers responded by ordering the book, to assist them in travel plans, and for use in geography and social studies classes.
As a convenience for teachers who haven’t acquired their copies an order coupon is printed at the right.
