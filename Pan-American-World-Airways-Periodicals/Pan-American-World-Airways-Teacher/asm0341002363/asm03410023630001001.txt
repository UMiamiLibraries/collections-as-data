ECONOMY" SERVICE PROVIDES RECORD LOW FARE FOR ATLANTIC AIR TRAVEL
Trans-Atlantic “Economy” air service will be inaugurated by the Flying Clippers on April 1, with an over ocean Thrift Fare of $252, one-way, $453.60 round trip.
In the period between June 1 and October 4 Pan American will provide the new low cost service on more than half of its transatlantic flights, offering more “Economy” service than any other airline.
The $453.60 Thrift Fare round-trip New York-London will be $329.40 lower than the first-class round-trip fai'e of $783, and $113.40 lower than the new tourist-class fare of $567. All new fares are subject to government approval.
Most of the “Economy” service will be operated in long-range DC-7C Clippers, newest aircraft in Pan American’s fleet.
Inauguration of “Economy” service is the second major victory for Pan American in its campaign for lower international air fares. The first was the introduction of transatlantic tourist-class fares in May, 1952. Juan T. Trippe, President of Pan American, had announced as early as 1943 that a $100 New York-London fare was his ultimate goal.
In 1945 when commercial air service was re-established across the Atlantic, Mr.

Trippe said the fare best suited to attract the average traveler was $275, or $100 lower than the fare then being proposed by international airlines.
Pan American placed this fare in effect but was forced to suspend it when foreign governments threatened to limit the airline’s flight frequencies to their countries.
Three years later, in September, 1948, Pan American inaugurated the first international tourist-class flights on its route between New York and Puerto Rico. Last year, it added a still lower fare service on this route: its Thrift Fare service at $52.50 one way. (Fares between the United States

and Puerto Rico do not require the consent of foreign governments.)
Each year beginning in 1945 Pan American presented and re-presented the idea of lower transatlantic fares at the IATA meetings which determine the fare levels on international flights. The transatlantic tourist flights which began in 1952 at greatly reduced cost were a result of these efforts.
The tourist fare level established then was $270 one way. $486 round-trip between New York and London. Pan American, after extending low fare service from Europe to the Middle East and beyond, completed a round-the-world low fare circuit in the spring of 1954.
On the “Economy” class flights to be inaugurated April 1, passengers will be served cold sandwiches, tea, coffee, milk and mineral water.
The accompanying tabulation shows how fares have come down during the past decade, despite inflation and rising operating costs. These latter factors have made it necessary to increase the amounts of fares in the First Class and Tourist categories, which now are at levels somewhat higher than the figures for previous years shown in the table. But the introduction of international tourist class flights to Puerto Rico in 1948, trans-Atlantic in 1952, and on other major routes in subsequent years has helped to make possible the attractive, low cost educational travel tour “packages” that are now available, and have helped to broaden the base of individual travel for educational purposes.
Now, the introduction on the Atlantic of “Economy” Service, following a thorough try-out on the New York-Puerto Rico route, moves the cost of international air travel down to a new low figure, while the cost of nearly everything else continues to mount.
