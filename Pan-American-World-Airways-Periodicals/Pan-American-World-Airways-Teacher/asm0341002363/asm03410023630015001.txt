EDWARD R. MURROW FILMS BRING McGRAW-HILL "SEE IT NOW" LIBRARY TO TOTAL OF 19
With the recent acquisition of POLAND, PUERTO RICO and AUTOMATION, the Text-Film Department of McGraw Hill Book Company now handles (among its 443 films) a total of 19 16mm Sound Versions of the Pan-Am-Sponsored SEE IT NOW series.
POLAND
The new mood and political climate in Poland since the Poznan riots and the “October Revolution” of last year, and the ways these changes are affecting the lives of the Polish people, are the subjects of this absorbing film by Edward R. Murrow.
Highlighted by an exclusive interview with Poland’s new Premier, M. Cyrankie-wicz, by CBS News Moscow correspondent Daniel Schorr, this wide-ranging film includes such different facets of Poland’s new freedom as rock ’n’ roll and a resurgence of open religious worship. The cameras reveal that in Poland, currently, freedom seems to be a particularly elastic word, embracing, as it does, a revival both of American jazz and un-American anti-Semitism. Reporter Schorr and cameraman Leo Rossi spent nearly two months in Poland compiling this absorbing, up-to-the minute film report of momentous changes in a troubled country.
PUERTO RICO
A probing study in migration, slums, prejudice and the attempts of an underdeveloped area to pull itself up by its “bootstraps,” this film explores through the documentary film medium some of the causes and effects of the annual migration to New York City and other metropolitan areas of 50,000 Puerto Ricans. Excellent camerawork and intelligent, lucid narration by Edward R. Murrow make this a highly provocative record of an important present-day problem.
16mm Sound 55 Minutes Purchase Price $195
AUTOMATION
Automation, the currently mushrooming industrial phenomenon in which man is substituting machines for human muscle, has repeatedly been called the greatest of all revolutions. Some consider it a grave menace to our way of life. To others it seems to be the ultimate panacea for everything that ails our nation. Assuming the truth to lie somewhere between these two points of view, Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly give, in this SEE IT NOW film, a better understanding of the many problems connected with this technological development, presenting viewpoints on automation ranging from that of a local union worker to those of a college professor and the head of one of the world’s largest corporations.
