Jet-Powered Clippers Ordered by Pan American World Airways
Jet-powered Flying Clippers, now on order by Pan American World Airways for delivery in 1958 and 1959, will reduce flying time New York, London to 6 hours and 15 minutes. New York will be 11 hours and 15 minutes from Buenos Aires by jet clipper. The Honolulu-San Francisco flight will be five hours.

According to an announcement by Juan T. Trippe, PAA President, definitive contracts have been executed with Boeing Airplane Company of Seattle, Douglas Aircraft Company of Santa Monica, and the Pratt & Whitney Division of United Aircraft Corporation of East Hartford, Connecticut, manufacturers of the jet turbine engines to be used.
Forty-five of the speedy jet aircraft have been contracted for, at a cost of 269 million dollars. They are the first U. S. - built jet aircraft to be purchased by a scheduled air line.
Twenty of the 45 aircraft will be delivered by Boeing between December, 1958, and November, 1959. The plane will carry 104 passengers in standard configuration and 125 in tourist. A substantial number of the Boeing jets on order to Pan American will be the first American built jet transports delivered and the first to go into regular service.
Delivery of 25 Douglas jet Clippers will begin in December, 1959, with the last to be received by the airline in January, 1961. These planes will carry 108 passengers with standard seating or 131 tourist-class passengers. The Douglas jet Clippers, which are scheduled for delivery a year after the Boeing type, will have a wing area 7 per cent larger, will carry six more passengers in tourist class, will have slightly greater range and will be equipped with a larger type Pratt & Whitney jet turbine engine.
Both aircraft are designed to cruise up to .88 mach number and a contract cruising speed of 575 miles an hour at 30,000 feet is the same for both types.
Pan American’s new jet Clippers will be placed in transatlantic, South American and transpacific service in the 5-month period

beginning December, 1958.
Mr. Trippe said that the planes will provide a new high standard in speed and in passenger comfort in Pan American’s pattern of non-stop over-ocean service. The vibration and noise caused by propellers will be eliminated, he said. In fact, there is complete absence of all vibration and the sound of the jet turbine engines is audible only to passengers in the very after part of the cabin. Cruising altitude will be well above the weather. The new aircraft are to be equipped with radar, as are present Clippers.
Ground noise also will be lessened by jet turbine silencers. The new jets will make little more noise on the ground than present piston-engined planes, Mr. Trippe said. Reverse thrust mechanisms, also fitted to the jet turbine engines, will act as brakes after landing, just as reversible propellers now do.
Behind the operation of these aircraft by Pan American in scheduled commercial service will lie years of experience on the part of Boeing, which has designed and built most of the four engine jet aircraft as yet produced — and on the part of Douglas which has built, over the years, the majority of all commercial transports now flying in the U. S. and throughout the world. Pratt & Whitney too are in the forefront of all jet turbine engine builders. In fact, their J57 jet turbine has already accumulated and will continue to build up a tremendous service experience in the Air Force and Navy.
Pan American, Mr. Trippe also pointed out, has now on order a fleet of 33 new DC-7C Clippers which, when delivered beginning next spring, will be the fastest and longest range transport aircraft in overocean service. The order represents an
investment by Pan American in an amount of $88,000,000. The additional investment of $269,000,000 in new jet Clippers, Mr. Trippe also stated, will, when delivered in 1961, double the capacity of the Pan American fleet. The total commitment of $357,000,000 for new flight equipment is concrete evidence of Pan American’s faith and confidence in the continued expansion of sound two-way international trade as well as greatly increased tourist travel between the United States and the 74 friendly nations which are regularly served by the Pan American Clippers.
Examples of flight times for future jet operation follow:
Route N.Y.-Paris N.Y.-London N.Y.-Buenos Aires Chicago-London Tokyo-Seattle
Miles Time 3,750 6 hrs, 35 min. 3,535 6 hrs, 15 min. 5,415 11 hrs, 15 min. 3,950 6 hrs, 45 min. 4,770 8 hrs, 32 min.
Honolulu-San Francisco 2,420 4 hrs, 30 min. Honolulu-Seattle	2,785 5 hrs
Commenting upon Boeing’s share of the jet project, William M. Allen, Boeing Airplane Company president, said, in Seattle, “Purchase by Pan American World Airways of 20 Boeing 707 Jet Stratoliners marks the beginning of a new era in air transportation. We have worked closely with Pan American since the inception of America’s first jet transport project in 1950.
“Introduction of the 707 Jet Stratoliner on Pan American’s routes will, in effect, make the world 40% smaller. Most major cities of the free wordd will be only 12 hours or less from the United States.”
Allen also pointed out that the contract announced today marks the “fourth major airplane type Boeing has built for the world-wide services of Pan American.” He recalled that it was the famed 314 Clipper flying boats which pioneered passenger service across both the Atlantic and Pacific. Earlier, Boeing built the Model 307 Strato-{Continued on Page T-2)
