Know the World
Beginning on the page opposite is a unit on the Scandinavian countries and Finland.
Until further notice, we’ll give you such a unit in each issue of World Airways Teacher. The next one will deal with Latin America.
The Educational Director of Pan American World Airways is constantly reminded of the need for attention to geography and social studies in his contacts with those in the company who are responsible for employing high school and college graduates. The constant complaint of these employing officials is: “Our new employees don’t know enough about geography!”
Geography and social studies are basic in the curricula of U. S. schools, and we consider that the subjects are adequately emphasized and well taught.
And yet Life Magazine (June 25) found it timely to publish an editorial entitled “It Don’t Pay to be Ignorant, Not When We Have Responsibility for all that Geography.” Life was pleading primarily for well-trained minds—not just for knowledge of geographical facts. But the editorial cited shortcomings in knowledge of geography, as revealed in the results of a New York Times survey of 4,752 college students, as being typical of what the editor seemed to regard as a shortcoming in the educational equipment of college graduates.
In the Times survey, only 18 out of the 4,752 could name the five largest U.S. cities and give their approximate population, only four per cent could name the states bordering the Great Lakes, only 17 per cent knew the population of the Soviet Union and half the students couldn’t even name three of the satellite states in Europe.
So there still is a problem.
We realize that study units by themselves won’t solve it, whether in World Airways Teacher or elsewhere. We recognize too that the best unit is the one devised by a teacher especially for a specific class, taking into account the prior learning experiences of the members of the class.
Nevertheless, we think there is a place for a series of units like this one on Scandinavia and Finland. Many of your students will soon set out upon careers in business, including aviation, in which they will travel abroad, or at any rate will deal with matters involving international trade. All of them will have to fit themselves to live not only in their own country, but also in the world.
How Was Your Vacation?
Scholastic Teacher would like to know, and if you will write an account of it in 750 to 1,000 words you may win a $25 prize.
The contest is for teachers, school administrators, supervisors and librarians. Tell about your travels to wherever in the world you went last summer—or last winter—and send photographs if you have them. There are nine $25 prizes. Additional honorable mention citations will be made and these winners will choose among the 43 titles in the Rhinehart “Rivers of America” series for their rewards.
Send entries not later than February 1, 1952, to: Travel Editor, Scholastic Teacher, 351 Fourth Ave., New York 10, N. Y.
The magazine also is conducting another contest specifically for travel photos. The originally announced deadline of October 1 may be extended. If you haven’t heard about this photo contest and have a picture you’d like to enter, write to the Travel Editor of Scholastic Teacher and ask if your entry still may be submitted.
Summer Schools in Europe
The Summer Schools for Americans at the Universities of Paris, the Sorbonne, Lille, and Barcelona in 1951 were so successful that the Richelieu Institute has, on the invitation of the Government of Portugal, founded another such Summer School for Americans at the University of Coimbra.
The courses at Coimbra will follow the same lines as at the Sorbonne; grammar, conversation, literature, and advanced stud-
ies. Under the Applied Arts Division of the Richelieu Institute, a new type of curriculum will be introduced, courses in Portuguese Ceramic Art, elementary, intermediate and advanced. Ceramic Art in Portugal is the most skilled and advanced in the world.
The courses are six weeks in length and will be held in Lisbon, a city known both for its beauty and its ideal climate. Free week-ends will allow members to- visit Spain, Tangier, Gibraltar and many other points of interest.
At the University of Paris, the Sorbonne, the courses will remain the same as in 1951.
The Richelieu Institute will inaugurate at Paris, under its Applied Arts Division, 3 courses in Fashion Designing and Cutting, elementary, intermediate and advanced. They will be held at Paris’ outstanding school of fashion designing. Included in these courses will be costume designing and stage settinj^^ and decoration as developed in the Frenc^B theatre.
At the University of Lille last summer the courses were given at Boulogne-Sur-Mer and over 50 students participated. They will be repeated in 1952.
The University of Barcelona will again hold the same courses, three weeks at Sitges, fashionable seaside resort j/2 hour from Barcelona, and the other three weeks at the beautiful Isle of Palma de Mallorca.
For further particulars write to the Richelieu Institute of University Studies Abroad, or the Sorbonne American Institute, Box 1405, Beverly Hills, California, or 300 Park Avenue, Suite 11D, New York 22, N. Y.
A New Kind of Traveler’s Handbook “NEW HORIZONS”
It is a 196-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about the countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
When New Horizons was offered to the traveling public in Pan American World Airways national advertising, thousands of teachers responded by ordering the book, to assist them in travel plans, and for use in geography and social studies classes.
