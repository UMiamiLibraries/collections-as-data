CLIPPER CARGO
(<Continued from Page T-2) ment stores in the United States travels by air. The same may be true for shipments from Italy and possibly other countries. Macy’s receives fifty shipments a month by Clipper Cargo, for a total of 7,000 to 10,000 pounds.
Many sunglasses come from France by air — the cost differential is slight and the shippers consider handling is better by air. Belts, handbags, hats, watches, feathers for millinery, artificial flowers, and jewelry are among other items which U.S. department stores receive from abroad by air.
Such items in general have the advantage of commodity rates. These are rates which have been established for particular commodities at rates less than the general cargo rate — each established after consideration of the difficulty or ease of handling, the amount of business that may be expected and other factors. It is available, on an equal basis, to all shippers of the particular commodity.
Household Goods. Furniture and household equipment are heavy and bulky, but it is often convenient and economical to send them by air — especially overseas. This is so largely because of the development of the “Airvanpack”, which is a disposable carton constructed of heavy-duty fiber board measuring five by five by seven feet, and with a capacity of 3,000 pounds or 150 cubic feet. Various items are packed in the container, by a specialist in moving and packing, and the crate then moves as one package.
In one of the early shipments with Airvanpack, the household of Gerald A. Drew, who had been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia, was delivered to his new home in La Paz just six days after it had been loaded on a moving van in Washington.
Because of savings in crating charges, landing charges and duties, Airvanpack frequently results in a financial saving, as well as a saving in time.

The aviation industry serves itself with Clipper Cargo and cargo on other air lines. Aircraft parts and complete aircraft engines travel by air to places where needed, so regularly that it is completely routine. And airplanes even carry airplanes! In 1957 about 150 Pipers, Cessnas and other light aircraft were shipped overseas by air — wings are removed and four or five can be shipped in one DC-6-A or DC-4 at a cost for trans-Atlantic shipment of $600 to $1,200, depending on weight.
All sorts of activities benefit from air shipment, and this includes the Girl Scouts of America, and their annual cookie sale. Some of the cookies delivered in the New York City area were baked in Virginia and flown to the Girl Scouts and Brownies who sold them, and similar delivery was used in other areas.
NOTE: A detailed, illustrated booklet on “Flying Cargo” has been issued by the National Aviation Education Council at 1025 Connecticut Avenue, Washington, D. C. It goes to members as a part of the service rendered to them, and may be purchased by non-members.
