STUDY UNITS
The teaching units in this binder appeared originally in the Pan American World Airways Teacher, a publication distributed to teachers by Pan American World Airways to assist them in relating aviation to the school curriculum, especially in geography and the social studies.
In response to a concerted demand for back issues, the study units were reproduced in this form and made available in the binder for a charge of $1.00, which partially covers cost of production and distribution.
World Airways Teacher itself is published every two months during the school term and mailed free of charge to any teacher requesting it. To obtain such listing, and for information about other educational offerings write to me at the address given below.
I will especially welcome comments regarding the study units, and reports on the ways in which they are used.
