THE WINNER—This is not an airplane—it is a gas model and the winner of the PAA-Load Event at the National Model Airplane Meet at Olathe, Kansas in August. Below is Herb Kothe of Omaha, Nebraska, launching the model on its prize
winning flight.
MODELS CARRY PAY LOAD
An event in which the powered models competing were required to carry “pay load” was sponsored this summer at the National Model Airplane Meet at Olathe, Kansas, August 4 to 8 by Pan American World Airways.
The event was for free flight models—the ones that fly by themselves until they use up their gasoline as distinguished from those which are flown at the end of strings. Further, the classification specified was the one known to modelers as R.O.G., Class “B”. Still further, each entrant had to carry two “occupants” which consisted of blocks of wood three inches wide and four inches high.
Prizes of $500, $250 and $100 to cover the cost of educational air trips via Flying Clipper were offered, also 10 qualifying prizes of $25 each.
The event attracted more than twenty-five entrants, all of whom had to design special models to compete. First place went to Herbert Kothe of Omaha, for a flight of 361 seconds, and his successful entry is pictured above. Fred Whiting III of Oklahoma City was second place winner and third place went to David Thomas of Indianapolis.
The event may be repeated next summer, and possibly introduced at some of the other meets, in addition to the National. Educational Service would be pleased to hear from modelers who would be interested, and welcomes suggestions.
