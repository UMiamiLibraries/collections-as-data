FLYING DELEGATES TO HERALD TRIBUNE FORUM DISCUSS
THE WORLD WE WANT
At the third annual Herald Tribune High School Forum, held this year on March 6 at the Waldorf Astoria, 29 students from other countries of the world joined with about 1,000 high school students from the metropolitan area of New York City in a day long session on the subject “The World We Want.” A distinguished list of speakers including Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and Trygve Lie, Secretary General of the United Nations addressed the forum, and there were two panel discussions conducted by the students themselves.
In the picture above William G. Avi-rett education editor of the N.Y. Herald Tribune is moderator of a group which had the topic: “What do you think about America?” In the group, left to right are Donald Peter Ewing of Australia; Johnny Christensen of Denmark; Terence Nelson of England; Casimir Ehrnrooth of Finland; Patricia Fender of England; Mr. Avirett, Merete Bjorn Hanssen of Denmark; Brynjulf Otnes of Norway and Ward Bourn and Frank Johnson both of the United States. The students from Australia and England flew to the U. S. by
