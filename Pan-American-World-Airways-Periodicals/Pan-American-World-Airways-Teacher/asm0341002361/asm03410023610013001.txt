WHAT DOES "ARCTIC" MEAN?
Webster’s New International Dictionary says the word arctic is derived from the Greek word arktikos, which, in turn, is from the Greek arktos, a bear, also the constellation which we know as the Great Bear or the Great Dipper. The term arctic refers to the area of the earth under the constellation, Great Bear.
Arctic is a common noun or adjective, often used in lower case, but it generally is capitalized when used as a proper noun or adjective, as in Arctic Ocean, Arctic Circle, Arctic Current, also the Arctic.
North Pole is capitalized in Webster’s, but pole and polar are common nouns; they may refer to either the North or South Pole, or to the poles of any sphere. In literature about the Arctic, writers use both forms, i.e., Arctic or arctic region, and Polar or polar region. In recent writings, capitals generally are used.
The word antarctic is from the same Greek source as arctic, with the addition of the prefix ant (i), for opposite, and is capitalized in Antarctic Circle, etc.
