(Continued from page T-3) sent the big airliner rushing off the ground at 1 p. m., and into the blue sky at the familiar sharp angle of ascent.
As the Clipper headed into the northwest, only splotches of France peeped through the cloud bank below. It seemed only a matter of minutes before we passed the historic white cliffs of Dover, then were over Prestwick, and heading out to sea, but over five miles above it. The seascape spread out in a limitless vista and, from our dome’s eye view of the world, it appeared we should be able to see from continent to continent.
As we started our letdown for Keflavik, the big airport in Iceland, Captain Harrell informed us that we were to make a practice GCA approach, being guided down by radar controllers on the airport miles ahead. He tuned the ground controllers into our individual speakers and we heard the radioed directions to our pilot: “You’re 5 feet over the glide path and 15 miles out ... 8 feet below the glide path and three miles from the airport . . . you’re on the glidepath and the center line of the runway is on your left.”
We touched down at Keflavik 3 hours and 23 minutes after takeoff from Paris. Time on the ground there was an hour, just long enough for everyone to look around the terminal.
After departing from Keflavik, Captain Harrell set the Clipper’s course to following the 62nd parallel just a bit south of the Arctic Circle. We were cruising at 24,000 feet at a speed of 600 miles an hour (eight-tenths the speed of sound), making the plane traveling faster than the speed of the sun at that latitude. Captain Harrell’s announcement of that fact was the highlight of the trip for many, but for others, it was the sight still ahead of us.
The monotony of the sea view suddenly was broken at about 4 p. m. by the sun sparkling onto the Greenland Ice cap. After flying across the great ice cap of unbroken ice and snow, we thrilled to the view of the snowy crests of rugged mountains which rose out of the blue waters of the ocean on Greenland’s west coast. It was a breath-taking sight and one which could have been seen from no other observation point as majestic.
Then there was nothing but ocean until suddenly the northeast coastline of the U. S. appeared and the Americans — like all persons coming home — started straining their eyes to identify a familiar landmark.
Clipper Mayflower swooped into New York’s Idlewild at about 7 p. m. (New York time). We had left Paris less than 10 hours before, crossed an ocean, and reached home in time for some to make good their boast of having lunch in Maxim’s in Paris and a late dinner in New York’s “21” the same day.
The trip was over, but we thought of the thousands of others who would follow our trail-blazing. For vacationers, the jets will mean trips never before possible; for business men, it will mean an accessibility of markets once believed out of reach, and for all, an introduction to a new way of travel life.
