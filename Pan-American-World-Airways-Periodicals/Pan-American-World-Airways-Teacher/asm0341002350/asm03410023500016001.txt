AIR AGE TEACHERS
The teachers shown in photographs on this page are members of an Airport Institute at Idlewild Airport.
These institutes, sponsored by air lines operating at New York City, in cooperation with the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Port of New York Authority, are designed to indoctrinate teachers who want information about aviation to help them in the class room.
Sometimes the institutes are held at La-Guardia and Newark Airports. Over the past four years nearly 3,000 teachers have participated.
An airport institute consists of hearing, seeing and doing, and it is illustrated in part by the pictures on this page which were taken when members of the Queensboro Teachers Association attended an institute at Idlewild.
The program started with an overview, continued with demonstrations, with models, of the operation of an airport, and the functioning of the Instrument Landing System.
Thereafter, in smaller groups, the teachers visited the control tower (picture at upper left) where C.A.A. Airways Operations Specialist Michael C. Mitsakos did the explaining. They visited the radar room, the customs, public health and immigrations area, and a ticket counter. Finally, all went aboard a Flying Clipper of Pan American World Airways for a flight over New York.
The picture at the upper right shows some of the institute leaders.
The picture of the pilot’s compartment of the Clipper shows Captain Leon P. Wilson, left. The picture at lower right has PAA Stewardess Diane Egan passing chewing gum to the teacher guest passengers.
Similar opportunities for airport institutes exist in many places other than New York City. Sources of information would be local offices of air lines and airport managers. The program in New York is coordinated by the NATCC, which is the National Air Transport Coordinating Committee at 270 Park Avenue, New York City.
