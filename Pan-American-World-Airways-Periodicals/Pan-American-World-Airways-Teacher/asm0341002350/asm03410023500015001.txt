Avianca Has 35th Birthday
December 5, 1954 was the 35th anniversary of the founding of AVIANCA—Aero-vias Nacionales de Colombia (Colombian National Airways), the oldest airline in the Americas. AVIANCA is an affiliate of Pan American World Airways System, and operates services in Colombia, from Colom-
bia to the United States and has a weekly flight to Europe.
Started with a small seaplane on the Magdalena River, AVIANCA today is “big business” with a fleet of 61 aircraft, including three new Super Constellations that were delivered in September by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. A fourth luxury airliner has been purchased and is scheduled for delivery next year.
During 1953, more than 1,000,000 passengers and 200,000,000 pounds of freight were carried by AVIANCA over its domestic routes in Colombia and in international services to the United States and Europe.
The Colombian people have been “air minded” for many years. Their country’s mountainous terrain has made them so, and this same terrain was probably the best impetus that commercial aviation received anywhere. The mountains made land travel slow and road building difficult. While Colombia has many navigable rivers, boat travel proved too slow.
Thus the airplane came to Colombia as a need, rather than a luxury, and the rapid development of air transport industry in the country was early assured.
On December 5, 1919, the Sociedad Colombo-Aleman de Transportes Aeros (Colombian-Germany Air Transport Company) was formed, combining German technical training and Colombian capital. In 1940, SCADTA and SACO, a smaller Colombian airline, operated 5,927 miles of air routes—one for every 1,574 Colombians —an interesting figure when one considers that at that time the United States airlines
MAGDALENA RIVER — Avianca began operations with one Fokker airplane, on floats.
operated one mile of air route for every 3,470 Americans.
In 1940, SCADTA and SACO were combined, and began operations under the name AVIANCA—Aerovias Nacionales de Colombia. The new company became an affiliate of Pan American World Airways, assuring a standard of service and operating efficiency surpassed by no other airline in the world. Its repair shops and overhaul base at Soledad Airport, Barranquilla, are among the finest in South America. While AVIANCA handles its own repair and maintenance in Colombia, it is serviced by Pan American Airways on its international routes.

TAKE THIS “COOK’S TOUR” FOR COOKS VIA A NEW INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK!
Right now, in your own home, or in your school’s domestic science department, you can take a gourmet’s excursion around 84 countries—via Myra Waldo’s “Complete Round-the-World Cookbook”.

The result is a cookbook that’s also a travel book—and fun to read as well as to cook from. There are entertaining descriptions of each country’s eating and drinking customs.
All recipes have been tested, and almost all ingredients are familiar and easy to get. For the few your corner grocer might not carry, there’s a geographical list of dealers who specialize in foreign foodstuffs.
