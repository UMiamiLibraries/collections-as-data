Something new has been added to the traditional trip to Bermuda at Easter Vacation time. Many of the college and secondary school groups last year traveled by Flying Clipper. More will do so this year.
The three hour flight to Bermuda, a ten-day stay at that unique vacation spot, and the three-hour flight back to New York all can be had for as little as $232 for transportation, lodging, meals and the essential incidentals such as ground transportation and the Federal and Bermuda taxes that apply.
The teacher or student who organizes a group for travel to Bermuda can travel free or at a reduced rate for the Clipper transportation, depending upon size of the group.
Consult your travel agent, or any Pan American World Airways ticket office. If inquiries are addressed to World Airways Teacher they will be referred to the appropriate PAA office.
