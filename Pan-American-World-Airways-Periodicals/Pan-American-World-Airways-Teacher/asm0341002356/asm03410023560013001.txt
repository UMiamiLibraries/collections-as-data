^NOW-CAPED CHIMBORAZO — In the centre of Ecuador, along the routes of Panagra, between the cities of Quito and Guayaquil is the mountain "Chimborazo" (6,310 meters high), called "The King of the Andes." The modern DC-6's of Panagra, which fly this route, take 50 minutes to go from Quito to Guayaquil, the two most important cities of the Republic of Ecuador.
