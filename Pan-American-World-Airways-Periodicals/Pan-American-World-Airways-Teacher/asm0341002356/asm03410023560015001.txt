LOWER FARES
(Continued from Page T-l)
prise and to offer the most value to the most people. That isn’t as obvious as it sounds. Because air transport does have the choice . . . the very clear choice ... of becoming a luxury service to carry the well-to-do at high prices ... or to carry the average man for what he can afford to pay. Pan American has chosen the latter course”.
Mr. Trippe made this statement in 1943, but the decision to provide low cost air transportation for the average man had been taken years before, and a program for implementing that decision was under way before Pearl Harbor. This program, of course, was delayed by World War II, and it could not be put into effect overnight when peace was achieved because the cost of a modern airliner is reckoned in millions, and operating costs are well up the scale from the “hay” class. The goal must be achieved by degrees. Volume must go up to bring prices down. It’s the familiar story of American business enterprise — volume production to achieve low unit cost.
What progress has been made, then, towards that goal of mass transportation for the average man at a price which he can afford to pay?
A little background information will be useful here.
It is necessary to have in mind that an Lternational air line cannot decide what re it will charge, announce it and go "ahead. These fares are subject to international agreement achieved through discussion in meetings of the International Air Transport Association, and then to approval by the governments of the countries involved — in the case of the United States, this means approval by the Civil Aeronautics Board.
This is a sound arrangement, preventing the possibility of rate wars which could destroy the industry, or segments of it. But like other democratic processes, it sometimes works slowly.
In the case of the three-phase fare structure, this is what happened: PAA proposed that three classes of services be offered at three fare levels, with the designations First Class, Tourist and Thrift.
The Civil Aeronautics Board, in the United States, was favorable, and since Puerto Rico is part of the United States, no international agreement was necessary. The fares for Puerto Rico service were set at: First Class, $100; Tourist Class, $64 and Thrift Class, $52.50. The Civil Aeronautics Board approved, and these fares became effective on June 20 of this year.
At the same time, Pan American proposed a comparable fare structure for service across the Atlantic, but this proposal required international agreement, so was introduced for discussion at the Meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Cannes, France. Counterproposals were advanced by other air lines, and the meeting ended with agreement for adoption of such a pattern in April of 1958, with a fare level approximately 20
per cent below that of the present tourist service, and possibly as low as $232 oneway, $417.60 round trip, for the New York/London journey, with relative reductions on other trips.
Meanwhile, though, interim steps for reduction of cost to the average traveller will be taken. First Class Atlantic fares will be reduced $40, effective April 1, 1957. Reductions available under the family plan, from November through March, are to be continued. A new 15-day tourist excursion fare for travel across the Atlantic, beginning October 1, 1956 and effective the year round, makes it possible to travel from New York to London round trip for $425.
Under the family fare plan for Transatlantic travel, when the head of the family pays full fare, there are reductions for the spouse and each child (12 to 25) of $150 one-way, $300 round trip from the first class fares, or $130 one-way, $200 round trip, from the tourist fares.
Let’s take a quick look, now, at the history of fare reductions.
We’ll cite in tabular form some examples of reductions which are typical of the trend. The fares given are the lowest available over the route in question in the year to which reference is made. It will be noted that there have been instances of
relatively small advances in fares. For example, there was a time when the Tourist Class fare, New York/London, had to be raised from $270 (one-way) to $290. These were necessitated by increases in operating costs. But there is an overall downward trend, accomplished by the introduction first of Tourist service, and now of the new Thrift Class, and this trend has brought about real savings.
These lower fares are made possible by different seating configurations — in other words the airplane outfitted for First Class carries a certain number of passengers, in a Tourist configuration it carries a greater number of passengers, each paying a lesser fare, and in Thrift Class, the seating capacity is still greater, the individual fare still lower. In addition there is a difference in meal service and certain passenger appointments. In the pilot’s compartment, there is no difference; operating standards, and notably, safety standards, are the same.
In short, the differences are very similar to those with which travellers have become familiar in surface transportation in ships, and on trains.
Now let’s see what this has brought about in terms of passenger fares for travel across the Atlantic and Round-the-World:

service available was First Class, and the fares were........ $375.00

In 1956, Family Fare saves $300 First Class, $200 Tourist, family head, Nov. through Mar.
In 1956 the 15-day excursion fare on Tourist service is.
Projected, for April 1, 1958, is the Thrift Class, 20 per cent
below Tourist Class, and expected to be approximately...
