Modern Talking Pictures, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City. (Available for showing to college and adult groups only). Although this film is planned primarily as a travelogue, there will be found many scenes which can be used as a basis for discussion, contrasting ways of life of the people in this British colony with the
BERMUDA
people in the United States as well as with people in the other British possessions.
BERMUDA TREASURE HUNT - 27 min. sd. Color. Modern Talking Pictures Service, 45 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City. (Available for showing to college and adult groups only). Produced by the Victor Kayfetz Productions, Inc.
The film opens with a heated argument by three couples as to how best to spend their little remaining time in Bermuda. The host of their accommodations proposes a treasure hunt as the solution. As the hunt begins next morning the three couples draw straws to see who will have the motor-driven bicycles, who the horse-drawn carriage, and who the convertible taxicab with the “fringe on top”, all popular means of transportation in Bermuda. When the selection is made clues are furnished and they all set off on different paths across the island. After an exciting morning following their clues and inclinations they are all back together
again for lunch in a cozy litle cove by the side of the sea. More clues, leading to a profitable afternon of sight-seeing and exploration, are furnished by their host after lunch.
By late afternon they are all back together again in the guest house, excitedly comparing their adventures. Further activities are Bermuda dinghy racing and dinner dancing. Although none of them have found a pirate’s cache they have all discovered the treasure of Bermuda.
