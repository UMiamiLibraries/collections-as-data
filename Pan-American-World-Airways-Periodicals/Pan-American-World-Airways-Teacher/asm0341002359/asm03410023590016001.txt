FORUM DELEGATES — The visitors from abroad for the Herald Tribune High School Forum visited Washington, D. C. during their stay in the U. S., and were received at the White House by President Eisenhower.
Thirty-three delegates from as many countries and more than 2,000 American high school students and faculty members attended the New York Herald Tribune's eleventh annual High School Forum on "The World We Want" in the grand ball room of the Waldorf-Astoria in March. Senators Clifford P. Case of New Jersey and John F. Kennedy were speakers.
There were also three informal panel discussions by the delegates based on the students' experiences with Americans and with each other. Mrs. Helen Hiett Waller, forum director, was moderator. A dance interlude was provided by three of the visiting delegates: Beatrice Kairupan, Indonesia; Yumiko Morii, Japan; and Chotima Danitanand of Thailand.
The thirty-three delegates were in the United States since from early January to the end of March and were guests in a total of 81 high schools and 124 homes.
This year's High School Forum brought to 293 the total number of students who have come from abroad for the forums, representing seventy-three foreign lands.
The delegates have participated in a weekly series of half-hour programs on WOR-TV on Saturdays at 2:30 p.m. This is the fifth successive year that the program has been presented as a public service through the cooperation of the Herald Tribune and WOR-TV, and the fourth year that the program has been kinescoped by the Educational Television & Radio Center for subsequent showing on educational TV stations throughout the U. S. "The World We Want," which is the theme of these programs as well as the theme of the High School Forum, features each week at least four of the visiting delegates.
Pan American World Airways has participated in the Forum program from its inception by bringing delegates from their homes abroad to the United States.
