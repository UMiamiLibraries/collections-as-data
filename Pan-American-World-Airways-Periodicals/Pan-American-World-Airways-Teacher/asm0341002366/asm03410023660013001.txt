COLOMBIA
LOCATION . . . Colombia lies at the northern end of the Andes, with Panama on the west, Venezuela and Brazil on the east and Ecuador and Peru on the south. It is the only country in South America that fronts the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
CHARACTERISTICS . . . Colombia is very Spanish in its culture and traditions. This can be seen in its churches, its old public buildings, and in its mountain towns. Bogotá, the capital, has often been called the Athens of America because it has been a cultural center since the time of the Spanish Viceroys.
The principal thoroughfares of Bogotá are Carrera 7a, Carrera 10a, Carrera 13 and Avenida Caracas stretching for about 90 blocks. The main shopping center is on Carrera 7a between Calles 10 and 25. In this area too are the fine hotels, clubs and theatres of the city. The national flower of Colombia is the orchid. It grows everywhere, but it is one of the sights of Medellin. Colombia is a country of infinite variety, from skiing in Manizales to jungle hunting and fishing in Leticia.
POPULATION . . . Estimated at 14,000,000, the country has about as many inhabitants as Canada.
SIZE . . . 439,830 square miles, slightly larger than Texas and California combined.
CAPITAL . . . Bogotá, with a population of over 1,000,000, is the size of the Kansas City metropolitan area.
GOVERNMENT ... A republic governed by a President.
