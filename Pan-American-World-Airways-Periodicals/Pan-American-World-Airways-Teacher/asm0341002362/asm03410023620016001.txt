PAA OPERATES ANTARCTIC CHARTER FLIGHT
A veteran Arctic pilot was in command and the newest Polar navigation instruments and techniques were employed when a big Pan American Strato Clipper made the first commercial flight to the Antarctic in history in October.
Under contract to the U. S. Navy, the giant plane carried 37 passengers from San Francisco to the U. S. Naval facility at McMurdo Sound, where it landed on a runway built on 15-foot thick bay ice.
The Clipper was under the command of Captain Ralph Savory of Seattle, Chief Pilot of the company’s Alaska Region — a man who has had more than a quarter of a century of flying under Arctic conditions.
Aboard the plane were two recently developed instruments which have been successfully used on Pan Am’s Polar Route from the Pacific Coast to Europe. One is a new type of gyro-compass, replacing the ordinary magnetic compass which has a tendency to become erratic and sluggish in the vicinity of the magnetic poles. The other was the “sky compass”, an instrument
similar to a sextant which polarizes the light rays from the sun and makes it possible for the navigator to check the heading of the aircraft even though the sun may be well below the horizon.
The passengers on the Antarctic flight, mostly officers and men of the Navy’s Antarctic Mobile Construction Battalion (Sea Bees) and some civilian technicians, flew from Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to San Francisco aboard a Pan Am DC-4 Clipper.
In San Francisco they boarded a doubledeck Strato Clipper which flew to Christchurch, New Zealand, via Honolulu, Canton Island, and Nandi, Fiji. Last leg was Christchurch to McMurdo.
Rear Admiral George Dufek, Commander of the U. S. Navy Support Force, Antarctica, announced that the Pan American flight supplemented the Navy’s logistics assistance to “Operation Deep Freeze III”, the purpose of which is to resupply the seven stations established in the Antarctic to support the U. S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year.
