This is a plan for interesting young people in AVIATION. Sculptured medals of outstanding pioneers in aviation are utilized to illustrate for boys and girls the stories of some of the men and women who have been responsible for the growth of one of the most important industries of modern times and to make youth conscious of the Air Age.
The Wright Brothers, Captain Edwin C. Musiclc, Amelia Earhart, Frank Hawks, Glenn Curtiss and General Billy Mitchell inspired the first six plaques to be designed. (See cut) Original plaques about 10" in diameter, from which the 1%" models are made, were designed by outstanding American sculptors. The original plaques are being presented to national public organizations and the Wright Brothers, Captain Musick and Amelia Earhart plaques are on display at the National Air Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C. The sister plaques are available for presentation to the home town of the personality honored. The Capt. Musick sister plaque
