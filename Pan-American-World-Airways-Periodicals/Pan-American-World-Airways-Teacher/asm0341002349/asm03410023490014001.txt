*The information presented under the heading “Quick Reference Facts” is from the PAA travel guide book New Horizons, 1954 revised edition.
“New Horizons” is a 576-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about 78 countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
The new edition is enlarged in all sections, includes 15 countries not represented in the earlier editions, and is printed in handy pocket size.
When New Horizons was first offered to the traveling public in Pan American World Airways national advertising, thousands of teachers responded by ordering the book, to assist them in travel plans, and for use in geography and social studies classes.
As a convenience for teachers who haven’t acquired their copies, or who now wish to order the new edition, a coupon is printed at right.
