One group of citizens, although doubtless relaxed like the others, is busy day and night — the people in charge of ringing church bells. There is infinite variety in pitch, timbre and rhythm. They call out to each other, and if you awake at 4:00 A.M. as I did, you’ll hear them saying ding-ding-ding-ding, BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG, dang dang, and so on. All in a most agreeable manner. I hope to go back and listen to them again and stop again at a charming continental style hotel, the Humboldt Capital.
Our first stop was at the Ministry of Education, — and we have the assurance of the Minister himself that he will personally see that arrangements are made for meetings with educators, visits to schools, and all such activities, wherever possible, provided we request them in advance.
Here is the quintessence of my factgathering during two days in Quito:
Universidad Central del Ecuador. A special summer session, with courses in the Spanish language, and in the history, traditions and culture of Ecuador, and

Latin America, is planned, and will probably be offered in 1958.
Universidad Católica, Quito. The faculty will welcome visits by our teachers and students. Here’s a special note: The Vice Rector said he’d like to arrange exchanges of books, particularly books on social laws, economics and education. Anybody want to take him up on this? Write to me, or if you prefer, write direct to Dr. Julio Tabor-Donoso, Vice Rector, Universidad Católica, Quito, Ecuador.
Casa de Cultura Ecuatoriana. This is a museum, library, research organization and publisher of periodicals and books. Of the several secciones, one is devoted to ciencias filosóficas y de la educación.
Its director is Jan Schroeder, a dynamic artist from Holland who came to Ecuador for Shell Oil, on an oil exploration project. Shell didn’t find oil, but the artist found a life interest in Ecuadorean native art and handicraft. Shell withdrew, but the artist stayed, and he has a big room in the Casa Cultura where a dozen Indians from various parts of the country blend their native skills with their mentor’s knowledge of modern tastes and techniques. Together they work out products and designs which will have ready sale today. The methods, styles and designs developed at Casa Cultura are passed along to the native industry, enabling it to compete in world markets and providing some mighty handsome products.
Cetitro Ecuatoriano Norteamericano. This is a “bi-national center.” It offers the year round courses in English language, traditions and culture for Ecuadoreans, most of whom attend at night, three hours a week. There is a four weeks summer seminar for Ecuadorean teachers of English in August, and a visit to the seminar could readily be arranged.
PERU
Arriving at Limatambo Airport, Lima, on PANAGRA’s “El Interamericano”, I was met by Ted Pelikan, PAA’s Regional Traffic Superintendent. Ted had me at his home in San Isidro an hour later, for dinner, and to inspect his personal collection of Peruviana, such as:
A llama whip — heavy wooden handle with gold and silver bands and a braided rawhide lash about six feet long — along with
A llama whip in stylized version, with silver handle, and lash consisting of silver chain with silver rosettes set with brightly colored jewels, and constituting the mace of authority of some ancient Inca monarch.
And along with these, a miniature version of a monarch’s staff of authority, a copy about eight inches in length, which served the purpose of identifying the king’s courier, when he took off across country on one of the Inca highways to carry news or orders to an outlying community.
Ted took me to see the radio tracking station which will keep the artificial satellite under observation during the Geo-Physical year — one of a dozen such being set up around the world. A hundred feet away from this forward-looking work of modern man is the beginning of one of the old Inca highways, at least 1,000 years old. On the other side of the station is an Inca burial ground, well dug over, and strewn with pieces of pottery, bones and skulls left untidily behind by amateur diggers.
Such reminders of antiquity can be observed on the fly as you travel in Peru, along with such programs as may be suggested by the summaries of my interviews there, as follows: (Continued on page T-4)
