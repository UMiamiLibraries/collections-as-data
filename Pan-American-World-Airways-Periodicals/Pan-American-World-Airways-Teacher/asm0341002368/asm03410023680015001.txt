ADVENTURES IN EDUCATION
PPan Am’s annual directory of educational |rs, “Adventures in Education” now is Riy for distribution.
This year, in keeping with the times, it is called “Jet Age Adventures in Education.” The book lists 131 tour offerings by travel agents, colleges and individuals, representing nearly 300 different group movements, since many of the tours are in sections, departing on various dates. Many of these tours offer college credit.
Adventures also presents much information about the subject generally. For one thing, it attempts a definition of the term educational travel, a term which means different things to different people, and it will be interesting to see if you agree with Pan Am’s definition.
The book also explains such matters as Pay Later, tour conductor’s privilege (which is free transportation in return for organizing a group) and Family Plan. Other sources of information about educational travel are listed.
For your jree copy address a post card to Educational Director, Pan American, P.O. Box 1908, Grand Central Station, New York 17, N. Y., and ask for “Adventures in Education.”
RECORD CARGO ON JETS
Pan American World Airways’ Jet Clippers ^^ire carrying up to five tons of cargo as well j^^full passenger loads across the Atlantic — IjraBHn during record-shattering flights, accord-^^g to an announcement by Willis G. Lipscomb, Vice President, Traffic and Sales.
The combined cargo and passenger loads being carried by the Jet Clippers is exceeding all expectations, he said.
Mr. Lipscomb cited Flight 100 of December 11, which carried nearly five tons (9,775 pounds) of cargo and mail and 99 persons — and made the trip in the record time of five hours and 41 minutes from Idlewild to London.
He said that eastbound across the Atlantic to Paris, Flight 114 carried 117,291 pounds of cargo and mail during the first 15 days of December while operating with a seat factor above 95 per cent.
This is an average of 7,819 pounds of cargo and mail on each flight — a figure comparable to what both a Super Stratocruiser and a DC-7, previously assigned to this route, together were able to carry.
From December 1 to December 15, Flight 100, Idlewild-London, carried a total of 85,928 pounds of cargo and mail, for an average of 7,161 pounds a trip — over half the cargo capacity of a DC-4 freighter.
Heavy cargo loads were aboard on all record-setting flights. A New York-Paris trip broke the speed record with a time of six _ hours and four minutes, carrying 7,698 ^^^Lunds of cargo and mail plus 110 persons. Hlother flight to London, carried 10,098 pounds of cargo and mail and 97 persons.
During the first 15 days of December, the heaviest cargo-lift was on Flight 100 to London on December 5, with 10,554 pounds of cargo and mail aboard.
