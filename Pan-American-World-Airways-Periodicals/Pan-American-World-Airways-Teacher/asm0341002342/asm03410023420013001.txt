THE AVIATION EDUCATION MOVEMENT: AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY COOPERATION AND CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT
The article beloiv is the entire first chapter of a publication of the Department of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration entitled Aviation in School and Community. This publication was based on material contributed by members of the Aviation Leadership Conference which met in Washington, D. C., last August. The editors advise that “This is not to be considered as a finished document on the subject, but will serve as a basis for additional material submitted by the educators and community leaders attending the projected conference in Washington during the summer of 1953.”
Regardless of the fact that the editors consider their task unfinished, the first chapter of Aviation in School and Community does give a complete and clear explanation of what aviation education is, and what it can do for the school and the community, and therefore is made available to World Airways Teacher readers here. The complete document is in the process of fur-thei' editing and will be available sometime during the coming year. Inquiries should be addressed to Aviation Education Staff, office of the Assistant Administrator for Program Co-ordination, Civil Aeronautics Adminis-
tration, Department of Commerce, Washington 25, D. C.

THE NATURE OF THE AVIATION EDUCATION MOVEMENT
In 1903 Octave Chanute, one of the nation’s foremost pioneers in aeronautical engineering, in commending the brothers Wright following the historic flight at Kitty Hawk, had this to say:
“........Its (the heavier-than-air
craft) first application will probably be military.......The machine
will eventually be fast; they (aircraft) will be used in sport; but they are not to be thought of as commercial carriers.”1 The draperies that hide the future from the present opened for Chanute sufficiently to allow him only the briefest of glances. He predicted accurately in the first three statements above quoted. That he failed to comprehend, in 1903, the tremendous role the aircraft has come to play in the world of affairs can be illustrated by any school boy conversant with the hundreds of tasks per-

formed each day by the airplane in its routine activities.
A Case in Point
Only thirty years after Octave Chanute made his 1903 pronouncement the aircraft made possible negotiations between American petroleum experts and Ibn Saud, King of Saudi Arabia, which not only won Arabian American Oil Company the right to develop one of the richest oil reserves of the world, but also brought in its wake a train of events which forcefully demonstrate the fact of the airplane’s social significance.
Saudi Arabia, because of the use of aircraft in commerce, was confronted with the problem of transcending from a. feudal to a modern society without taking any of the intervening steps granted other civilizations. Space allows only a general reference to Saudi Arabia’s problems and to the aviation events which brought them about. It permits us only to observe that the oil interests there have been quick to educate the Arabs to an understanding of the Aviation Age and to the skills required of those employed by Aviation.
Saudi Arabia is not an isolated case. Aviation’s impact is felt in every corner of the world. Complex societies feel this impact
