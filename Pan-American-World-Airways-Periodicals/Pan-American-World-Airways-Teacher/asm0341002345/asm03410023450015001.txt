QUICK REFERENCE FACTS
AUSTRALIA
LOCATION:
The smallest of the continents, Australia lies in the South Pacific about as far south of the equator as Mexico and our southern states are north. Thus the country is in the temperate zone except for parts of the north which reach into the tropic zone. The island of Tasmania, included in the commonwealth, lies about 100 miles off the southeastern coast.
CHARACTERISTICS:
This is the “sunshine continent,” an open, smiling land of beautiful beaches, wonderful fishing, fine skiing and good golf. Australians spend most of their lives out-of-doors. They are marvelous sportsmen. Australians and Americans are alike in many ways. You’ll find yourself quite at home “down under.” There is, of course, no language barrier, although you will find some of their terms unfamiliar. But Australia has something for everyone who enjoys new sights, new experiences. The cities are cosmopolitan, the roads good, the people hospitable. Much of Australia is wild and uncultivated, but the parts the average American tourist visits have most of the comforts of home with the advantage of being different and colorful.
POPULATION:
8,752,819.
SIZE:
2,974,581 square miles, approximately the area of the United States. Tasmania is slightly larger than West Virginia.
CAPITAL:
Canberra, a city of 26,732, about 200 miles southwest of Sydney. Melbourne is 454 air miles from Sydney.
GOVERNMENT:
A British commonwealth, Australia consists of six states (including Tasmania) and the Northern Territory, which are self governing on local matters. The country as a whole is governed by a Federal Parliament and a Governor-General who represents the Queen.

LOCATION:
New Zealand consists of two large islands (North Island and South Island) and numerous small islands of which Stewart Island, just below South Island, and Chatham Island, 500 miles to the east, are the largest. Auckland is about 1,300 air miles east of Sydney, Australia; and about the same distance south of the Fiji Islands.
(CHARACTERISTICS:
New Zealand is truly unique—a wonderland of scenery, a sportsman’s paradise and a delightful spot for a completely different vacation. In its small area the scenic wonders of the world are reproduced. The Southern Alps and the fiords, the delicate native bush, the fertile and lush farmlands, the lakes and waterfalls compare favorably with anything in Europe or America. Then there are the wonders of the thermal areas, the beauty of the rare Glow-worm Cave at Waitomo, the immensity of the Kauri Forest. All New Zealanders are active sportsmen. They have the best fishing in the world, a great variety of game animals, excellent beaches and splendid winter sports. An interest in sports permeates the whole of life in this country with its open spaces and uncrowded atmosphere, a place to really relax. New Zealanders are third and fourth generation descendants of early British colonists and have much in common with Americans. On first acquaintance they appear reserved but they are naturally friendly and hospitable and the visiting sportsman is welcomed as a blood brother. European New Zealanders live in harmony with native New Zealanders, the Maoris, whose delightful arts and traditions have contributed much to the culture of the country.
POPULATION:
Estimated at just over 2,000,000—roughly the same population as Detroit. Auckland the largest city (350,000 inhabitants) is about the size of Hartford, Conn.

The information above is. quoted from “New Horizons”, which is Pan American World Airways’ travel handbook.
“New Horizons” is a 19,6-page travel report, with hundreds of photographs, especially drawn maps in two colors, and up-to-date facts about the countries of the world.
It tells what clothes to take, what to do about laundry and tipping, how to have fun, what to see and buy, and everything else the
air traveler needs to know to be happy and comfortable and save money.
When New Horizons was first offered to the traveling public in Pan American World Airways national advertising, thousands of teachers responded by ordering the book, to assist them in travel plans, and for use in geography and social studies classes.
