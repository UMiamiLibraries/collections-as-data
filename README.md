# collections-as-data
This repository is a pilot project of the University of Miami Libraries Digital Strategies depaartment. It contains machine-readable data generated from materials in UM Libraries collections. Our repository name is a nod to the inspirational work of [Thomas Padilla, Laurie Allen, and the rest of the Always Already Computational: Collections as Data team](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/team/)

Our first dataset is from the newspaper [La Gaceta de la Habana](http://merrick.library.miami.edu/cubanHeritage/cubanlaw/lagaceta.php), the paper of record during the Spanish colonial occupation of Cuba in the nineteenth century.

If you have feedback about this project, or any of the datasets, we welcome it -- either via GitHub issues or via [email]('mailto:p.morgan@miami.edu').
